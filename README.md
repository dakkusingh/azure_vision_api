# Azure Cognitive Services API

Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services exposes machine learning APIs and enables developers to easily integrate  intelligent features - such as emotion and video detection; facial, speech and vision recognition; and speech and language understanding - into their Drupal applications.

## [Face API Module](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/face/)
Face API Module integrates with Microsoft Face API, a cloud-based service that provides the most advanced face algorithms. Face API has two main functions: face detection with attributes and face recognition.

![Face - Detect](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/face/images/face.detection.jpg)

* Detect human faces and compare similar ones
* Organize images into groups based on similarity
* Identify previously tagged people in images

Following API methods are available in the current release.

Face API detects up to 64 human faces with high precision face location in an image. And the image can be specified by file in bytes or valid URL.

## [Emotion Recognition API Module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/emotion/home)

The Emotion API beta takes an image as an input, and returns the confidence across a set of emotions for each face in the image, as well as bounding box for the face, from the Face API.

### [Image Analysis](https://westcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/56f91f2d778daf23d8ec6739/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fa)
This feature returns information about visual content found in an image. Use tagging, descriptions, and domain-specific models to identify content and label it with confidence. Apply the adult/racy settings to enable automated restriction of adult content. Identify image types and color schemes in pictures.
